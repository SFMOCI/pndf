Public Notifications Data Format project
====

This is a project by the San Francisco Mayor's Office of Civic Innovation to establish best practices for public notifications by City departments and to standardize messaging. 

The Public Notifications Data Format (PNDF) will be a data layer produced from existing data held by city departments, capable of accommodating the full spectrum of public notices, including filming permits, road closures, tree removals and license applications. 

SFMOCI intends to pilot the use of the PNDF with platform partners in Fall 2014, to enable members of the public to browse and search notifications, and to subscribe for updates on given topics in their chosen geographic area of interest. 

This repo contains notification.txt, a schema that lists the proposed fields to be used in public notifications, and notification_types.txt, an in-progress typology of notifications produced by City departments. Both are at a draft stage; comments and additions are encouraged.
